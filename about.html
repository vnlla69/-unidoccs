                <h2>The Idea</h2>
                <p>UNIDOCCS was born from recognizing the growing need for secure, verifiable document storage in education and professional sectors. Traditional systems are vulnerable to damage, forgery and loss, while blockchain technology offers immutable records and instant verification</p>

        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>1. What is UNIDOCCS?<br>
                UNIDOCCS is a blockchain-powered document storage and verification platform that lets you securely upload, store, and share important credentials (diplomas, certificates, licenses, etc.) with tamper-proof proof of authenticity.
        </p>

        <p>2. How does blockchain make my documents secure?<br>
            When you upload a document, UNIDOCCS creates a unique digital fingerprint (hash) of the file and records it on an immutable blockchain ledger. Any change to the file would produce a different hash, so anyone can instantly detect tampering.
        </p>

        <p>3. Which blockchain network do you use?<br>
            We currently write document hashes to [Network]. This ensures wide decentralization and permanent availability.
        </p>

        <p>4. Do I need any special software or hardware?<br>
            No special hardware is required. You only need a Web3-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to connect, upload, and manage your document proofs.

        </p>

        <p>5. What file types are supported?<br>
            You can upload common document formats, including PDF, DOCX, JPEG, and PNG. Each upload is hashed regardless of type; the original file is never stored on-chain.
        </p>

        <p>6. Is there a size limit for uploads?<br>
            Yes - each file must be under 10 MB. If you have larger documents, you can split them into smaller files or compress them before uploading.
        </p>

        <p>7. How much does it cost to store my document?<br>
            Uploading and anchoring a document hash requires a small blockchain transaction fee (“gas”). Fees vary by network congestion; you will see an estimate before you confirm.
            
        </p>

        <p>8. How can I verify someone else's document?<br>
            Recipients simply paste the verification link or scan the QR code you share. UNIDOCCS will compare the hash of the presented file to the on-chain record and show “Valid” or “Invalid” instantly.
            
        </p>

        <p>9. What if I lose access to my Web3 wallet?<br>
            Because the on-chain record is public, you can re-generate your document's hash from any device and verify it against the blockchain. However, to manage or add documents you will need to restore your wallet using your seed phrase.
            
        </p>

        <p>10. Can institutions or employers integrate UNIDOCCS verification into their systems?<br>
            Yes. We provide a simple API and embeddable verification widget so organizations can automate credential checks directly from their own portals.
            
        </p>

        <p>11. How do I get started?<br>
            1. Click Get Started on the homepage.<br>
            2. Connect your Web3 wallet.<br>
            3. Upload your document.<br>
            4. Confirm the transaction to anchor the hash on-chain.<br>
            5. Share your verification link or QR code.<br>
            
        </p>

        <p>12. Where can I find more help?<br>
